       In true computer science style I'll present blocks world as
       another tutorial.  You should have done "starting" first,
       and it would help if you read the guide before trying this
       one, particularly the part on the Edit Interface.

       This tutorial covers more advanced editing, and constraint
       creation and management. The aim is to create a blocks
       "pyramid".

       I recommend frequent saving, after every edit op, for
       instance.

         1.  Start up the program (easy, isn't it).

         2.  Create a plane, edit it but leave it at the origin (ie
             just Finish it).  Note in passing that a scaling
             constraint is in force, even though you didn't choose
             it. This is an example of a forced constraint, where
             the Scaling Point and Origin have a dimension in
             common, in this case they have equal Major coords.
             There is a section on forced constraints in the user's
             guide.

         3.  Create a cube, and edit it.

         4.  We want the cube to sit on the plane, and stay there.
             So what we need is a constraint that specifies the
             plane. It's probably best to choose the most general
             constraint that satifies the relationship you want.
             So in this case we want to specify a plane constraint
             that corresponds to the actual plane in the world.

         5.  To specify a plane constraint, choose Plane from the
             Add menu in the Position box. A red square will appear
             on the vertex closest to the mouse, and then follow
             the mouse around by snapping to the nearest vertex.
             Note also the the cursor has changed to a pointing
             hand, indicating point selection.

         6.  Now the next issue. We want the box to stay on the
             plane even if we move the plane, so we want Reference
             points, or points that move with the object they lie
             on. Use Button 1 to choose 3 non-colinear points from
             the plane. Lets take the origin and 2 points from
             extremes of the cross type representation. If you have
             the defaults set up, some of the plane points are
             off-screen. Lets fix this.













                                  - 2 -



         7.  Hit undo to cancel the point selection, then choose
             Zoom from the View menu (Edit dialog) and set it to a
             smaller value (80). Now you should be able to see most
             if not all of the plane. Choose Add Plane from
             Position again.

         8.  To choose the origin, push down with button 1 when the
             little red square is on the origin. When you push the
             button down, something will change colour.  Either the
             object will go black, or the plane will go red or the
             axes will change. The object that changed colour is
             the one referenced at the moment by the point you have
             the mouse down over. Move the mouse around a bit while
             the button is down. The colour change should cycle
             around the objects just mentioned as the system cycles
             through possible choices for the referenced object.
             You want the plane, so when it's red, let go of the
             button. The complication is that the mouse also has to
             be inside the square, so you have to be careful to get
             the right referenced object while still being close to
             the square. Choose 2 other plane points using button
             1.  Try the one to the left in the foreground and to
             the right in the foreground.  If at any time you get
             it wrong, choose undo and try again.

         9.  You will be asked for a name for the constraint.
             Choose something useful so you can remember what it
             is. I'll use BasePlane. After entering the name a
             BasePlane button should appear as an available
             Position constraint. If you accidentally selected the
             object as one of the defining points, you will be
             warned that the specifier was changed to an absolute
             point. This is because most constraints can't
             reference the object itself, so the system changes
             them to something more appropriate. Anyway, none of
             that should have happened.

        10.  For the sake of example, choose the Remove button and
             click on the constraint that you just created. It
             should disappear again. We actually want it, so click
             on Undo and it will be put back.

        11.  Select the BasePlane constraint, and move the box
             around a bit. You may be wondering why we didn't just
             use the X-Y Plane constraint. The reason is that the
             X-Y Plane constraint is tied to the Origin. It moves
             with the Origin. It doesn't express the "On" relation
             that we want.

        12.  But, you say, the Cube is not on the plane, it's in
             it. Now things get interesting. What we really want is











                                  - 3 -



             the base of the cube to lie in the plane - ie we want
             to constrain the base of the cube, not its center.
             Since the Origin is the thing we constrain, this
             equates to putting the Origin on the base of the Cube.
             So do it. Choose Origin from the dialog box and pick
             one of the points on the base of the cube, say the
             point at the center of the base.

        13.  A couple of things should happen quickly. Most
             apparent will be the Cube jumping up so that it sits
             on the BasePlane. This is so that the constraint you
             specified (the BasePlane) is satisfied by the new
             Origin.  You'll see that the Origin and Axes have
             moved onto the base of the Cube.  The constraint
             specifying points all have little red squares around
             them too. The size says they're Origin constraints and
             the colour means they're reference points. The grey
             square representing the resultant constraint also
             appears.

        14.  Change the Origin again, this time putting it on the
             corner diagonally opposite the Scaling Point. Notice
             that the Cube doesn't move this time, because the new
             Origin already satisfied the constraint.

        15.  To build the pyramid we want 4 cubes arranged around
             the z axis, and another on top. So we want to position
             the cube with one corner at the world origin. So add
             another constraint, this time a line corresponding to
             the world z-axis. Choose Add Line from the Position
             box, and select 2 points. We want this constraint to
             be fixed in space - in other words it's an absolute
             constraint. So use button 3 to choose the 2 points on
             either end of the world z axis. Call it ZAxis.

        16.  Select the ZAxis constraint. The cube will jump so
             that the Origin is at the world origin (where the axes
             meet). Note also the circle around the Origin point.
             This indicates that it is point constrained, so you
             can't move it (the line and plane constraints combine
             to give a point). The cursor is now a circle when over
             the Origin. There are also specifier squares drawn in
             green on the ends of the axes, indicating they are
             absolute specifying points.

        17.  Finish it there for the moment. Just choose Finish,
             WITHOUT deselecting any of the constraints.

        18.  Now edit the Plane again. Select it (by dragging over
             it with button 1) and choose Edit from the Object
             menu. Then select the plane off the Edit menu. When











                                  - 4 -



             the Plane is drawn for editing, notice that the cube
             you were just editing is drawn dashed. THis is because
             it depends on the plane for its definition. Remember
             the reference points used to select a constraint for
             the cube? These imply that the cube depends on the
             plane.

        19.  Move the plane up a bit. Choose the Y-Z Plane and Z-X
             Plane Position constraints. Together they combine to
             give the Z axis. Just move the plane up a bit. The
             cube moves to follow the plane. This is constraint
             maintenance, where the dependancies are re-evaluated
             and the cube adjusted to satisfy the new constraints.

        20.  Click on the Maintain toggle in the main window to
             turn interactive maintenance off. Now as you move the
             plane the cube stays where it is. Its constraints now
             won't be updated until you finish editing the plane.
             Turn maintenance back on again. The only reason you
             would want it off is if the evaluation of dependants
             was making the system too slow. The cube will snap to
             its proper location.

        21.  Edit the Cube again. Note that all the constraints
             come up as they were before, still selected.

        22.  Scale the cube a bit. Choose the Minor-Other Pl
             constraint and drag the Scaling Point around a bit.
             Notice that the Origin stays fixed ie the Origin is
             the center of the scaling. Use undo to get back the
             unscaled state. Note that if you go far enough Undo
             will deselect the constraint also.

        23.  Choose the Uniform Scaling constraint. It's always a
             line from the Origin to the Scaling point. Scaling
             along this line will give equal scaling in all
             directions. Try it and see. Use undo to get back to
             the unscaled state.

        24.  Now lets get powerful - arbitrary axis scaling. Change
             the Minor Axis of the Object. Choose "Redefine 1" from
             the Minor menu in the dialog. Then choose the point on
             the base of the cube diagonally opposite the Origin. A
             few things will happen. The Axes at the Origin will
             rotate, so that the green axis is pointing from the
             Origin out to the point you just selected. The Major
             axis stayed where it was (it will unless you change
             it) and the Other (blue) axis moved to be
             perpendicular to the other two. At the same time, the
             Major-Minor Scale constraint activated. This is
             because, in terms of the new axes, the Origin and











                                  - 5 -



             Scaling point have the same Other Axis Coordinate. If
             you didn't get what I just said ignore it - the
             program enforces it to save itself from impossible
             states (but its not sensible to enter those states
             anyway).

        25.  Given the forced constraint, select the Minor-Other Pl
             Scale constraint also. These combine to give a line
             constraint. Scale along this constraint.  Notice how
             the Cube shears. Pull it out until you get a nice
             diamond shape.

        26.  Now rotate the Cube, but in a predictable way. We want
             the diamond to point out along the X axis of the
             world. We'll use Allignment constraints to do this.

        27.  First decide how you want the cube to orient itself
             with respect to the plane. We want the major axis, the
             red one, always perpendicular to the plane. To fix
             this, select Allign Plane from the Major menu. Choose
             3 points on the plane using button 1. Make sure that
             you reference the plane when you select them (it
             should highlight red for each point you choose) and
             that they aren't colinear. The order of selection
             matter too. It defines which normal to the plane you
             get (there are 2 possibilities). The program takes the
             normal that is parallel to the cross product of a line
             passing from the first point to the second point and a
             line passing from the first point to the third point.
             When the points are selected, the constraint is
             immediately enforced. The body doesn't change because
             it already satisfies the constraint. The Major Axis
             rotation constraint becomes forced to stop you
             breaking the constraint, and the points you used to
             define the plane have small red squares around them.
             The small size indicates they are allignment
             constraints, the red means they are reference points.

        28.  Now we want to allign the Minor axis so that it stays
             parallel to the X axis.  The do this, choose Allign
             Line from the Minor menu, and select, by reference or
             absolute (button 1 or 3), the negative then positive X
             axis endpoints.  Negative has to be chosen first
             because the order gives the line direction, and we
             want the Minor Axis to point in the positive X
             direction. When the points are chosen the cube will
             reallign itself to satisfy the constraint.  The Minor
             rotation constraint will also be enforced. Note that
             because of this the resultant rotation constraint is
             not an axis any more, so you can't freely rotate the
             cube. the cursor is also a closed circle when in the











                                  - 6 -



             window, indicating that rotation is not possible.

        29.  Finish editing the Cube here. Go back and edit the
             plane a bit. Notice that even if you rotate the plane,
             the cube will always stay perpendicular to it and
             sitting on top. Undo everything so that the plane ends
             up where it started.

        30.  We want 3 more cubes, the same size and shape as the
             first, but arranged around the center. So select the
             cube (not a cube any more), and choose Copy from the
             Object menu, to make one copy (for the moment). The
             copy will go on the Edit menu. Deselect the original.

        31.  Edit the Copy. Note a few things. It's in the same
             position as the, with the same size and shape, and the
             same constraints. The constraints are copied because
             it's easier to Remove than Add constraints.
             Constraints that depended on the object itself have
             however been changed to reference the copy.

        32.  We want to rotate the new object by 90 degrees, so
             that it lines up with the positive Y axis. Do this
             simply by choosing Allign Line from the Minor menu and
             choosing the negative then positive ends of the Y
             axis. The cube will rotate to satisfy the new
             constraint.

        33.  Copy two more cubes, and allign them with the negative
             X and negative Y axes respectively. You should then
             have 4 diamond sort of shapes with one common edge and
             each 90 degrees from its neighbour.

        34.  Edit the Plane again. Move it around and rotate it and
             watch the cubes follow.

        35.  Finally, a cone for the top (so much for blocks
             world!). Create a cone, and edit it to put it on top
             of the cubes. The easiest way to do this is to add a
             point constraint for where the cubes meet in the
             middle, set the origin of the Cone to be the center of
             its base, and select the point constraint. Try it
             yourself. The next item does it in detail.

        36.  Choose Add Point from the Position Add menu, then
             select the point at the top where all the cubes meet.
             Use button 1, because we want the cone to move with
             the rest of the structure. Make sure that one of the
             cubes is highlighted when you let go of the button. It
             doesn't really matter which one.  Then choose Origin,
             and set the Origin to be the center of the base of the











                                  - 7 -



             cube (a forced scaling constraint will activate). Then
             select the Point you added a second ago. The Cone will
             jump to the top of the pyramid.

        37.  Make sure the cone stays alligned. Choose appropriate
             allignment constraints to do so. Use Allign Line from
             the Major menu to allign the Major axis with the
             common edge of the cubes. Select 2 points to define
             the line, the first where the cubes meets at the
             bottom, the second from where they meet at the top.
             One of the cubes should highlight each time you choose
             a point. Use Allign Point form the Minor menu to
             allign the Minor axis.  Select a refernence point
             (button 1) from the tip of on of the cubes (not where
             the origin is, preferably in the direction the minor
             axis is already pointing). The Minor Axis is now
             constrained to always point toward the vertex you just
             chose.

        38.  Scale the cone to make it taller. Change the Scaling
             point by selecting the Scaling button and then
             choosing the vertex at the peak of the cone.  2
             scaling constraints will enforce, giving a line. Scale
             the cone up along this line. Finish editing the cone.

        39.  What you've now done is create a fully constrained
             pyramid. Moving the BasePlane will cause the whole
             thing to readjust itself to keep the relationships you
             specified accurate.

        40.  Set the names of things, just for good style. Select
             all the objects in the scene (drag across the whole
             window with button 1). Choose Name form the Object
             menu, and enter a new name for each object in turn.

        41.  Set the attributes of the objects. Try making the
             blocks a bit reflective.  You can set the attributes
             of all the blocks at once by selecting all of them,
             then choosing Attribs from Object just once. All the
             blocks will get the same attributes.

        42.  Create a light or 2, and set the ambient. Lights are
             edited the same as everything else, so you can
             constrain the light to always stay at a particular
             spot if you like. Set the colour of lights through
             their Attributes. Only Colour has any relevence, and
             it controls both colour and brightness.

        43.  Choose a target, your favorite raytracer.













                                  - 8 -



        44.  Set the Camera by adjusting the View parameters until
             it looks like what you want, then set the Camera to
             "Viewport".

        45.  Export it and save and quit.

        46.  Raytrace the result and enjoy.
